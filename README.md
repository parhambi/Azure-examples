## Overview

This repository serves as a practical guide for developers looking to integrate MuleSoft with Azure services. The primary example focuses on the integration with Azure Key Vault, showcasing how to manage secrets securely. By using OAuth 2.0, we ensure that the communication between MuleSoft and Azure is secure and reliable.

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure storage solution for secrets, keys, and certificates. This integration allows you to manage sensitive information without exposing it in your codebase.

## Integration Examples

### Key Vault Integration

In this section, we will cover how to integrate MuleSoft with Azure Key Vault. This integration allows you to securely access secrets stored in Key Vault.

#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure account
- Azure Key Vault created
- MuleSoft Anypoint Platform account

#### Step 1: Create an Azure Key Vault

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Click on "Create a resource" and select "Key Vault."
3. Fill in the required details and click "Create."

#### Step 2: Add Secrets to Key Vault

1. Navigate to your Key Vault in the Azure portal.
2. Click on "Secrets" and then "Generate/Import."
3. Add your secrets by providing a name and value.

#### Step 3: Configure OAuth 2.0

1. In the Azure portal, go to "Azure Active Directory."
2. Click on "App registrations" and then "New registration."
3. Fill in the application details and click "Register."
4. Once registered, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
5. Under "Certificates & secrets," create a new client secret.

#### Step 4: Implement in MuleSoft

1. Open Anypoint Studio and create a new Mule project.
2. Add the necessary dependencies for Azure integration.
3. Use DataWeave to transform your data as needed.
4. Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate with Azure Key Vault.

#### Example Code Snippet

```xml
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration" doc:name="HTTP Request configuration" >
    <http:request-connection host="vault.azure.net" port="443" protocol="HTTPS" />
</http:request-config>

<set-variable variableName="accessToken" value="#[your_oauth2_access_token]" doc:name="Set Access Token" />

<http:request method="GET" config-ref="HTTP_Request_configuration" path="/secrets/your_secret_name" doc:name="Get Secret">
    <http:request-builder>
        <http:header headerName="Authorization" value="#[vars.accessToken]" />
    </http:request-builder>
</http:request>
```

This snippet demonstrates how to make a GET request to Azure Key Vault to retrieve a secret using the access token obtained through OAuth 2.0.

## Technologies Used
